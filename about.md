I am a programmer, a nerd and an environmentalist.

It all began in the early 90’s when my family had a vote whether to buy a microwave oven, or a Nintendo Entertainment System. Needless to say, the NES won and my mom was downvoted 4 to 1. I’ve been in love with computers ever since.

As a developer, I'm on a continuous mission of transforming spaghetti code to lasagna; one bit at a time.

I work as a software developer @[tretton37](http://tretton37.com) where I spend most of my days writing C#.
